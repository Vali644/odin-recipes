    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>
            Prep The Cabbage. <br>
            As I mentioned, there's very little prep that's needed to get the cabbage ready for rolling. 
            What I do like to do is soak the sour cabbage in cold water overnight, but usually I forget and 
            I'll soak it for about an hour while I prep my other ingredients and do other stuff in the kitchen.
             I do this, to remove some of the salt from the cabbage, as it can be quite salty.
            Once the cabbage has soaked in water for a bit, you want to take each leaf and cut some of 
            the core from it. However, if you've already bought a jar of cabbage leaves, you may not even
             need to do this. Then I cut each leaf in half, since I like to make my cabbage rolls smaller. </li>
        <li>
            Prep The Filling. <br>
            Another thing that sets our cabbage rolls apart is that we actually cook the onion and the rice 
            for a bit before adding it to the meat mixture. So basically you'll want to sauté the onion in 
            some vegetable oil for about 3 minutes until softened. Then add the rice and toast it for 1 minute.
             Let it cool while you get the other ingredients ready.
            Now, in a large bowl, you'll want to add the ground pork, salt, pepper, parsley, dill, and the 
            onion mixture. Mix it well with your hands until well combined. Use the salt sparingly since the cabbage leaves are brined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat The Oven. <br>
            Now is the time to preheat your oven, so get that going to 375°F (191°C),
             so that it's nice and warm when we put our cabbage rolls in.</li>
        <li>
            Make The Rolls. <br>
            Fill each leaf with about a ¼ cup of the meat mixture and roll tucking in the
             ends as you see in the video. Repeat with all the remaining meat and cabbage leaves.
        </li>
        <li>
            Assemble The Rolls. <br>
            If you have any leftover cabbage leaves you'll want to chop that up and spread 
            some on the bottom of a large Dutch oven. Then place the cabbage rolls on the 
            chopped cabbage in a single layer. Next, you'll want to top with bacon, and be generous.
            Finish with another layer of cabbage rolls, more bacon and a bit more chopped 
            cabbage. If you like you can also season with some ground pepper.
            Now, you'll need to pour the tomato juice over the cabbage rolls and add additional
             water as needed. You want to make sure the rolls are completely covered with liquid.</li>
        <li>
            Bake The Cabbage Rolls. <br>
            Cover the Dutch oven with a lid or aluminum foil if your pot doesn't have a lid and 
            transfer it to the oven. Bake for 2 hours, then remove the lid or foil and cook for another 1 to 1.5 hours. </li>
